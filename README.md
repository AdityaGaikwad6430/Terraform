# 🧐 Terraform Repository 🚀

Welcome to my Terraform practice playground — where I nurture my hands-on skills with Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

This repository showcases my growing mastery of Terraform through organised, functional examples.

##  Directory Structure

Each folder contains Terraform configuration files, named to reflect their focus—making navigation intuitive:

- **`/for_each/`** ,**`/Count/`** – Includes modules for setting up VPCs, subnets, and security groups  
- **`/Instance/`** – Hosts configuration for virtual machines, instances, load balancers  
- **`/Remote-backend/`** – Manages buckets, volumes, and storage infrastructure

##  Purpose & Goals

I curiously built this repository to:

- **Strengthen** my real-world Terraform capabilities  
- **Document** reusable patterns that mirror how industry projects are structured  
- **Share** my learning journey with others exploring Terraform’s power
